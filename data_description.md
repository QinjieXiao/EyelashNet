Due to hard drive corruption and loss of up-to-date data, I am sorry that I am unable to provide the same amount of data as shown in the article at this time. I will try my best to find useful data from the previous backups. I will try to make up the rest of the data as much as possible.

Some information about the current open source data set is described below.

The [BaselineTestDataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hf_NpYcNMENovsNBFLxcfxDORkWq7KDN?usp=share_link) consist of 66 [captured data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z9WmRiQ5tjNgrIej2g3G9M2bEq28k6FR?usp=share_link) and 31 [Internet data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bR8r1zCvt8yX9FLdtNpFGT3Xwk-R2Grz?usp=share_link)

[RenderEyelashNet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Fn20KGOFr7j7qyIjLcCQX6tDbE_LRol?usp=share_link) contains 4760 training data and 621 testing data.

[EyelashNet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1apS34-DIokrC-9Nx4z0Zl7Ko9r7bL1HJ?usp=share_link)  contains 3301 eyelash matting data.


All images are 512x512 resolution. Each subdirectory of dataset folder contains:

image: the eyelash images.

mask: the eyelash alpha matte.

trimap (if it exists): trimap generated from the alpha matte.

blue (if it exists): the captured fluorescent images.

eyelash_mask (if it exists): eyelash fluorescent mask.

gray_trimap (if it exists): gray image.
