Due to hard drive corruption and loss of up-to-date data, I am sorry that I am unable to provide the same amount of data as shown in the article at this time. I will try my best to find useful data from the previous backups. I will try to make up the rest of the data as much as possible.

Some information about the current open source data set is described below.

The [BaselineTestDataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1A0ARlEK7Gg3XpnAJZ-5Ovg?pwd=oewe) consist of 66 [captured data](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QlRyIlZnUcHaIlHjhmrkBw?pwd=5qlr) and 31 [Internet data](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1S-HCk_rynuVavxD99RifSA?pwd=2gc2)

[RenderEyelashNet](ttps://pan.baidu.com/s/1DI6QbpabCi78VVo-NHhn1Q?pwd=w32l) contains 4760 training data and 621 testing data.

[EyelashNet](https://pan.baidu.com/s/12SytqouM06VWC4cgAnvUAA?pwd=nj4s)  contains 3301 eyelash matting data.

image: the eyelash images.

mask: the eyelash alpha matte.

trimap (if it exists): trimap generated from the alpha matte.

blue (if it exists): the captured fluorescent images.
